## Introduction

This single page app will help its users to keep up to date with their to-do's in real time.
The landing page consists of a text input form in which the user will submit their name.

Once in the specific view of a user, they can add new items, mark them as completed or delete them.



## Getting started

Through the command line get to the enclosing folder for the project and install all the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Once that's finished, you can go ahead and start the development server locally with:

```
npm start
```

After that you can go to http://localhost:3000/ and have a look at the app!

If you'd like to run the test suite, from the same folder just run:

```
npm test
```
